        <h2>üë®‚Äçüî¨ About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Hard-working biomedical engineering student at the University of Sheffield. Currently, I am predicted a first-class degree and undertaking modules related to microbiology, research, and biomaterials, focusing heavily on natural and synthetic polymers.       
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For my final year dissertation, I am studying a material for use in neuroglial blastoma in-vitro research; this involves producing the material over a 3-week period in cascades of complex laboratory procedures, mechanically testing the material with varying constituent components, and finally seeding cells as seeing if they survive in a simulated environment. One of the current challenges is that the material is mostly made of crosslinked type one collagen, which is mostly absent in the brain. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Another module I have decided to take is preparation for practice, which gives you 100 hours of university credit time to study whichever field you prefer. For mine, I studied Fusion 360 to upskill the knowledge I gained during my year in industry. Furthermore, I worked on my python skills using CodeCadmy. This allowed me to showcase the skills I have learnt and gave me more career options, especially in research roles related to AI, a larger topic I covered.

          Finally, I produced a portfolio website using THREE.js during the 100 hours, this is the website you are currently viewing, and it uses many languages together to produce a nicely animated website.
